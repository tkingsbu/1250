A critical step in the software development process is requirements gathering, during which the development team gathers and comprehends stakeholder needs. To find out their objectives, difficulties, and preferred features of the product, users, clients, and other stakeholders must be approached. The team makes sure that both technical and non-technical needs are met by precisely documenting these criteria. By making sure that everyone engaged is aware of the project's goals, this stage serves to lay the groundwork for the entire development process. A precise and comprehensive requirements collection process lowers the possibility of subsequent, expensive errors, revisions, or scope changes. It also guarantees that the finished product fulfils the expectations of the stakeholders and accomplishes the intended business objectives. 


Here are five user stories for developing Notion software based on my Writing Assignment 1 example:

As a user, I want a customizable workspace, so that I can adapt the platform to my personal workflow and easily manage my tasks, notes, and projects.
As a user, I want to drag and drop elements (such as tasks, notes, and media), so that I can effortlessly organise information without complicated steps.
As a user, I want real-time editing and collaboration features, so that I can work on documents simultaneously with my team and receive immediate feedback.
As a user, I want to be able to add comments to sections of a document, so that I can provide detailed feedback without interrupting the flow of the content.
As a user, I want the ability to create linked databases, so that I can efficiently organise and retrieve related information across different sections of my workspace.
